#Things to take care while installing project locally:
  
1)Open .env file and add the your details 
   like-Port number on which you would like to run the server locally(it could be anything -8001/8080 but should not be already used by your system) 
   or mongodb cloud/local url 

2)Run the mongoDB server locally or add the cloud url in .env. Not require when you are testing just frontend but for testing backend code locally you would require      mongo server which is running.
